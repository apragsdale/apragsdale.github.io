We have projects for students (both graduate and undergraduate) and postdocs
interested in population genetics, evolutionary biology, math, software
development, and physical anthropology. Almost all projects involve some level
of math and statistics although there is a wide range of possible topics, from
development of population genetic theory to empirical analyses of genetic data
to learn about demographic or evolutionary history. More information about our
research and interests can be found [here](2_research.html) or by browsing our
[recent publications](3_publications.html).

Our group is based in the [Department of Integrative
Biology](https://ibio.wisc.edu), and we accept graduate students through the
[Integrative Biology Graduate
Program](https://integrativebiology.wisc.edu/prospective-students/). If you are
interested in joining the group or learning more about positions and potential
projects, please [email me](mailto:apragsdale@wisc.edu).
