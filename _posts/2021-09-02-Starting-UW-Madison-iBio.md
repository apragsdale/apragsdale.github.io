title: The Ragsdale Lab opens in iBio
---

As of Fall 2021, I've arrived in Madison and the lab is getting up and running!
Check out the [research](2_research.html) page to get a sense of what we do,
and [opportunities](4_opportunities.html) if you're interested in joining us.
Informal inquiries via email/DM/stopping me on the sidewalk are always welcome!
