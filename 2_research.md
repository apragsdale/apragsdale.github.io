### Deep population structure and human origins  
 - single origin vs reticulated history
 - unidentified archaic or deep branches within African populations
 - studying geographically and genetically diverse populations within Africa to make sense
of these signals

___

### The impact of natural selection on diversity statistics and evolutionary dynamics
 - DFEs
 - bias due to background selection, effects of which are largely unknown
 - dynamics of alleles under background selection, studying using whole-population forward
 models, such as _fwdpy11_

___

### Theorical and computational approaches for diversity statistics
 - such as linkage disequilibrium and the allele frequency spectrum
 - for many populations and non-standard assumptions (population structure, inbreeding,
 selection)
 - evolution equations (_moments_, _moments-LD_), computing from genotypes (_MBE_
 paper), computing from gene genealogies (such as tree sequences, implementing in _tskit_)

___

### Other projects

#### Domestication history of *Brassica rapa*  

#### Conspecific attraction and the maintenance of diversity in hybrid zones
