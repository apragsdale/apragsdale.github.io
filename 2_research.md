My research aims to understand how evolutionary forces are expected to shape
genetic diversity within populations, and then uses this understanding to learn
about demographic and selective histories and processes from genome sequencing
data.

One focus of my research is on developing population genetic theory that lets
us predict patterns of diversity and genetic structure under varying models of
demography and selection. Another focus is on turning that theory into
computational tools to compare model predictions to observations from natural
populations. Finally, I have a strong interest in inferring (mostly) human
evolutionary history from genetic data, including both ancient history and
population structure as well as more recent migrations, movements, and
dynamics.

Most of my projects therefore combine at least some of developing mathematical
theory, running large-scale simulations, building and maintaining
[software](7_software.html), and inferring history from whole-genome sequencing
data.
