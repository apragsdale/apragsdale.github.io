title: New preprint on selective interactions and LD
---

In my latest preprint on
[BioRxiv](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.03.25.437004v1), I take
a look at how interactions and interference between selected mutations shape
patterns of diversity and linkage disequilibrium and whether we can learn about
those interactions from population genetic data. Here, I extend an approach
based on moment equations for the diffusion approximation to include general
selection models (epistasis, dominance, or any combination). This lets us
explore how LD decays with recombination distance for any interactive model.
I also look at LD in genic regions in human populations. The main takeaway is
there's a lot of heterogeneity of both selection strengths and interactions
within genes, with opposing effects between missense mutations inside vs
outside of annotated features and conserved elements. Plenty more analyses and
discussion in the paper. Please reach out with any comments or questions!
