I study the evolutionary and historical processes that shape molecular and organismal
variation. My research combines the development of evolutionary theory, computational
approaches, simulations, and application to large-scale sequencing datasets to make
inferences about evolutionary and demographic history from data.

In Fall 2021, I joined the Department of Integrative Biology at the University
of Wisconsin in Madison. Stay tuned for updates, and check out
[opportunities](2_opportunities.html) to join our group as an undergraduate or
graduate student or post-doc.

From August 2020 to August 2021, I was a post-doc in the [Moreno
Lab](http://www.morenolab.org/) at Langebio-Cinvestav in Irapuato, Mexico. From
2017-2020 I was a post-doc working with [Simon
Gravel](http://simongravel.lab.mcgill.ca/Home.html) in the Department of Human
Genetics at McGill University. I developed theory and computational tools to
predict and measure patterns of linkage disequilibrium and diversity, which is
used for the inference of demographic history in multi-population models. My
primary projects focused on learning about human origins and deep population
structure in human history. 

Previously, I was a graduate student with [Ryan
Gutenkunst](http://gutengroup.mcb.arizona.edu/) at the University of Arizona.
There, I built methods to analyze sequencing data to learn about demographic
history and to infer the distribution of selective effects of new mutations.
