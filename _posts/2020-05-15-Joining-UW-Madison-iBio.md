title: Joining the Department of Integrative Biology at UW-Madison
---

Beginning Fall 2021, I will be joining the Dept of Integrative Biology
at University of Wisconsin, Madison! I'll be recruiting postdocs and
graduate students to work on projects in population and evolutionary
genetics - check out [Research](% 2_research.md %) for an idea of our
research projects and interests and please get in touch if you are
interested!
