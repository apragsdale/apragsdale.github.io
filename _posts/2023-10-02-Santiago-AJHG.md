title: New paper inferring complex demographic models for Latin American populations
---

Santiago's paper, "Demographic modeling of admixed Latin American populations
from whole genomes" is now published in
[AJHG](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ajhg.2023.08.015) ([bioRxiv
link](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.03.06.531060v1))! In
collaboration with Andr√©s Moreno at LANGEBIO and other researchers at
LIIGH-UNAM, we inferred detailed demographic models for Latin American
populations using whole genome data, including 50 newly sequenced whole genomes
from Indigenous individuals in Mexico. The demographic models are big
improvements over existing models for demographic history in the Americas, and
you can simulate data using simulation software that support
[Demes](https://popsim-consortium.github.io/demes-docs/latest/introduction.html)
(such as [msprime](),
[fwdpy11](https://molpopgen.github.io/fwdpy11/intro.html),
[dadi](https://dadi.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), and
[moments](https://momentsld.github.io/moments/)). The models are provided as
supplementary files in the publication, and can also be found on
[github](https://github.com/santiago1234/mxb-genomes). In Santiago's paper, we
show how these models can be combined with parameters of selection to run
realistic genomic simulations of functional variation in admixed Latin American
populations.
