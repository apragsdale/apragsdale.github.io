title: Our article on deep population structure in Africa is published in Nature
---

We are excited to share that our work on understanding ancient population structure
within Africa is now published as an
[article in _Nature_](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06055-y)!
In this paper, we use geographically and genetically diverse populations across
Africa and Eurasia to reconstruct detailed demographic models for our species
in the deep past. We find that a model that includes long-lasting population
structure, with populations connected by ongoing migration, provides the best
fit to the genetic data. In contrast to other recent studies, we do not find
evidence for a substantial contribution from an unidentified "ghost" population
within Africa (akin to Neanderthal and Denisovan contributions in Eurasia).
This work is in collaboration with my former postdoc advisor Simon Gravel, at
McGill University, Brenna Henn and Tim Weaver at UC Davis, and others.
