title: Postdoc position available in population or quantitative genetics
---

Our lab here at UW-Madison is recruiting a postdoctoral researcher. We have an
opening in an NIH-funded (MIRA) postdoc position to work on the development
and/or application of population genetics approaches for evolutionary
inference. There is quite a bit of flexibility in research focus. Possible
projects include demographic inference in humans and hominins (in particular,
the deep evolutionary history of both modern and archaic humans), inference of
natural selection and selective interactions (such as dominance, epistasis, or
background selection), and connecting selection on quantitative traits (e.g.,
stabilizing selection) to selection on trait-contributing variation in
non-equilibrium demographic settings. Potential applicants with related
interests in population genetics and evolution are encouraged to reach out via
email with informal inquiries.

UW-Madison offers a vibrant and interactive research community in evolution,
genetics and genomics ([Evolution at UW-Madison](https://evolution.wisc.edu/)).
Quality of life in Madison, Wisconsin, is high, with excellent biking and
public transit infrastructure, affordability, and ready access to both outdoors
and urban activities.

The position follows the NIH postdoc salary scale. Start date is flexible, with
possible start dates between Fall 2024 and Spring 2025.

Informal inquiries are welcome and should be emailed to Aaron Ragsdale
(apragsdale@wisc.edu), and more information about our lab and research can be
found on our webpage (https://apragsdale.github.io/).

To apply, please email apragsdale@wisc.edu with your CV by August 31, 2024.
